# Setting up the Development Environment

## 1. Get the Project

This project uses Git for version management.

Clone the project from GitHub:
`git clone https://github.com/mixedjames/rippledoc.git`

You will also need `push` access and an Access Token.

## 2. Set up the toolchain

This project uses the following technology stack:

- TypeScript
- Webpack
- ESLint (todo)

These are all `node` packages.

All you need to is:

1. Have `node` installed along with `npm`
2. Open a terminal and `cd` to the project root
3. Run `npm install`

Testing is easiest with some sort of live server & some sort of development environment. I use VSCode.
