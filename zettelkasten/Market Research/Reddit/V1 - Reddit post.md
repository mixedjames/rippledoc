Making flowing, structured e-learning easier — without coding

### Content

Hi everyone!

I’m a doctor by profession and a developer on the side, exploring ways to create **e-learning modules with a clear, logical structure**, where each part of the lesson naturally builds on the previous one. The goal is to make content easier to follow and remember, **enhanced by thoughtful visual design**. Subtle animation and dynamic positioning — for example, holding a graph in place while the accompanying text changes — can help guide learners’ attention and support the flow, without being flashy or distracting.

Many existing approaches fall short:

- **PowerPoint or similar slide decks**: linear and rigid, not ideal for hierarchical lessons.
- **Raw HTML or CMS pages**: too technical and time-consuming for a creative workflow.
- **Typical “interactive” e-learning**: banal clicking exercises or forced interactions — what I think of as **gamified busywork** — that don’t enhance learning, just keep learners from running it as a background task.

The idea I’m exploring is a tool for building **scroll decks**: lessons that can include sticky elements, parallax, or lightweight animations — **only as tools to support clarity and pacing**, not as flashy gimmicks. The key is that creators **don’t need to write code** to produce a single HTML file that works across devices.

I’d love feedback from educators, instructional designers, or anyone who has tried interactive/scroll-based e-learning:

1. Do you use methods like this, and do they help your learners?
2. How do you currently create lessons that flow naturally and engage learners without falling into “gamified busywork”?
3. What are the biggest challenges or blockers in creating this type of content?
4. Would a tool that lets you stay in the **creative/design mindset** while producing flowing, interactive lessons be useful?

Thanks in advance for any insights or examples you can share!
