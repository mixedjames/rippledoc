### What’s the best workflow for creating flowing, scrollytelling-style lessons (without coding)?

Hi all,

In my field (medicine) we do a lot of post-grad learning. A lot of it is lectures — and as a logical/visual learner this really hasn’t worked for me over the years. I still find clear written content is best, but ideally with structure and visuals woven in.

I'm trying to figure out a way to do something about this myself. e-Learning seems like a good medium for this but too often, “e-Learning” ends up as:

- **Death-by-slideshow** (PowerPoint dressed up as “training”)
- **Gamified busywork** (“click the box so we know you’re awake”)

This misses both the strengths of classic textbooks (thorough exposition, reader-led exploration) *and* the potential of the new medium (animation, page-less design).

Recently I’ve been inspired by some scrollytelling examples — lessons where, as you scroll, a diagram builds step by step, or a chart stays fixed while the text changes. Done carefully, this feels like a natural flow from concept → detail → back again. It also echoes Tufte’s ideas: clarity, structure, and visuals that support the content rather than decorate it.

Here’s the problem: I can’t find a sane workflow to **create** content like this.

- **PowerPoint/Prezi** → too rigid, slideshow-y
- **Raw HTML/JS** → closest match, but not a workflow I’d wish on myself or colleagues

So my question is: **is there a good workflow or tool you use for producing this kind of structured, flowing lesson content?** I’d love to avoid wasting time trying to invent something if the community already has good practices here.

Thanks in advance for any insights (or examples that worked well for you).
