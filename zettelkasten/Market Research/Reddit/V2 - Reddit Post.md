### Would a tool for creating flowing, scroll-based lessons (without coding) be useful?

Hi everyone,

I’m a doctor with an interest in medical education and, in particular, effective e-learning. A lot of medical education ends up being very presentation-heavy — lots of slides, often with space-filling graphics. Videos are increasingly used, but they often suffer from the same issues. Personally, I learn best when content has a **clear logical structure** and when visuals are tailored to make a specific point, not just pulled in as filler.

Recently I’ve been enjoying the medium of **scrollytelling**. It can be awful if misused, but I think careful use of scroll-triggered content can be powerful. For example:

- A graph or diagram that builds as you scroll, paired with description.
- Subtle animation to show when we’re diving deeper into a concept and then returning to the big picture.

I also think this approach could borrow from principles that Edward Tufte champions: clarity, minimalism, and visuals that truly serve the content.

I’m a programmer in my spare time, so I’ve been experimenting with designing a simple tool to support this workflow — something that would let creators focus on lesson design, not code.

I’ve tried a few common tools without much success:

- **PowerPoint:** difficult to create flowing content; everything ends up looking like a slideshow; long content is awkward.
- **Raw HTML (and other web tools):** can get the look I want, but it’s labour-intensive and I find it hard to be creative when I’m in “code mode.”
- **Prezi:** I don’t find the zooming model helpful.

I’d love some thoughts from the community:

- Do you use methods like this, and do they help your learners?
- How do you currently create lessons that have a clear and naturally flowing structure?
- What are the biggest challenges or blockers in creating this type of content?

And ultimately: would a tool that lets you stay in the **creative/design mindset** while producing flowing, interactive lessons be useful?

Thanks in advance for any insights!
