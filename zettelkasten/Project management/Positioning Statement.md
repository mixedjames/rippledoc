# RippleDoc – Concept-Driven, Flowing Learning Documents

## Positioning Statement

**Purpose:**  
RippleDoc is designed for creating structured, linear-flow learning documents that combine the clarity of classic written content with the benefits of interactive media.

Think of it as a way to produce “animated PDFs” — not in the literal sense, but in terms of clear, stepwise visual storytelling — without being locked into proprietary platforms or subscriptions. Unlike typical “slideshows” or templated e-learning tools, RippleDoc emphasizes conceptual structure over rigid page-based layouts.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Structured, linear flow:**
   Guides the learner from concept to detail and back, reflecting the logical progression of ideas.

   _This is not a slideshow model_ — the focus is on the content’s conceptual structure, not discrete slides.

2. **Interactivity without distraction:**
   Supports selective animations, stepwise diagrams, and visual scaffolding to reinforce understanding.
3. **Linking is encouraged:**
   Includes in-document links, sidenotes, and external references to connect knowledge without fragmenting the main flow.
4. **Standalone portability:**
   Documents work offline, can be shared via email, cloud storage, or USB, and are not tied to proprietary platforms.
5. **Open & future-proof:**
   Designed to avoid vendor lock-in, with FOSS at its core, reducing risk of content loss or bitrot.
6. **Intuitive content-structure alignment:**
   Writers can see the logical flow of their document as they author it, without requiring a heavy GUI or complicated toolset.

**Target Users & Collaborators:**

- Educators and subject-matter experts who want to create conceptually structured, interactive documents without wrestling with heavyweight LMS tools.
- Collaborators interested in FOSS or lightweight authoring workflows, enabling offline-first, portable content.

**Core Differentiator:**
RippleDoc leverages scrollytelling for education. It is _not a slideshow_. The content produced is portable, and yours.

Conceptual logic dictates presentation, not the tool.
