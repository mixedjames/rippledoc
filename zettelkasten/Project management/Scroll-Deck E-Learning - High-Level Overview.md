# Scroll-Deck E-Learning: High-Level Overview

## Elevator Pitch

Create an interactive, scroll-based e-learning format that combines the logical flow and scalability of slides with modern scroll-triggered effects, sticky/parallax elements, and flexible content length. The goal is to enable educators to create engaging, interactive learning materials that are performant and accessible across a wide range of devices.

## Goals

- Provide a structured yet flexible authoring environment for interactive learning content.
- Support variable-height slides and cross-slide visual elements.
- Enable scroll-triggered animations, sticky elements, and parallax effects.
- Maintain accessibility and usability on low-spec machines and standard institutional environments (e.g., NHS desktops).
- Produce single distributable files (e.g., HTML) that can be shared easily without triggering security blocks.
- Balance advanced functionality with authoring simplicity, optionally supporting lightweight Markdown formatting.

## Target Audience

- Educators creating interactive e-learning content.
- Institutions needing lightweight, cross-platform learning materials.
- Learners benefiting from visually structured, scroll-based presentations.

## Gap in Current Tools

- **PowerPoint / Keynote**: Linear slides, good scalability, but poor support for scroll-based effects, sticky elements, or content extending across slides.
- **Web-based frameworks (Reveal.js, Impress.js, Deck.js)**: Often require significant coding for advanced animations, limited WYSIWYG support, and can be heavy or complex for low-spec machines.
- **Markdown-based tools**: Simple to use initially, but quickly become messy and ambiguous when advanced effects or precise layouts are needed.

Our approach fills the gap by offering **structured, scalable authoring with advanced scroll and layout features**, while remaining distributable and lightweight.

## Priorities (High-Level Order)

1. **Cross-platform support**: Windows, Mac, Android (future iOS/Linux).
2. **Performance on low-spec machines**: Smooth scroll, animations, and rendering.
3. **Authoring experience**: Simple text-based DSL with optional Markdown, future WYSIWYG.
4. **Core interactive features**: Variable-length slides, sticky/parallax objects, scroll-triggered animations, cross-slide elements.
5. **Single-file distribution**: Avoid reliance on servers or heavy frameworks.
6. **Extensibility**: Future support for quizzes, keyframe animations, and multi-author collaboration.
