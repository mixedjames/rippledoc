**RippleDoc – Animated PDFs for Concept-Driven Learning**

Tired of slide-based tools and heavyweight LMSs? RippleDoc helps you create structured, linear-flow learning documents that combine the clarity of classic written content with interactive, stepwise visuals. Think of it as producing *“animated PDFs”*—not literally, but in terms of smooth, concept-driven storytelling—without proprietary lock-in or subscription fees.

**Why it’s different:**

- **Not a slideshow:** Conceptual logic drives the flow, not rigid page layouts.
- **Portable & self-contained:** Works offline and can be shared anywhere.
- **Interactive clarity:** Stepwise visuals, diagrams, and sidenotes enhance understanding.
- **FOSS-friendly:** Open workflows minimize vendor lock-in and ensure your content stays yours.

RippleDoc is for educators, subject-matter experts, or anyone frustrated with traditional e-learning tools who wants to focus on ideas rather than slides.
