# August 2025

**25/8/25**
- Upload to Git for first time!
- Toyed with idea of functional-style DOM but getting bogged down in weeds

**26/8/25**
- Added lexer.ts (converted to TS from a JS project with ChatGPT assistance)
- Added initial test suite for lexer.ts

**28/8/25**
- Added parser.ts + test suite
- Currently parses for syntax errors but doesn't build AST or parse tree or anything like that
- My first effort at writing a recursive *ascent* parser which, it has to be said, has been a more pleasant experience than the recursive descent version
	- *TODO: write some more about recursive ascent parsers!*
